# Front-end

The `frontend` folder holds the website and mobile application.
These may be in a single instance, using a native-API framework, or a Webview compiler...
Or they may be in multiple instance, if code-bases are separated for the apps, like using a native framework for the mobile application and another framework for web-apps.
